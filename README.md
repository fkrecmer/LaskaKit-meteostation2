# LaskaKit-meteostation2

The LaskaKit Meteo Mini v3.5 circuit board is based on the powerful ESP32-C3-MINI microcontroller, featuring a BME280 sensor that provides accurate readings for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.

This repository contains sketches for the [LaskaKit Meteo Mini Meteostanice 2.0](https://www.laskakit.cz/laskakit-meteo-mini-meteostanice/), compact weather station designed for weather enthusiasts and hobbyists.
This repository is a personal playground where I experiment and have fun with coding. Please note that it is not intended to replace any official repositories. Enjoy exploring, and feel free to share your thoughts and feedback!
